# JEngine

The JEngine is a Framework for Production Case Management (PCM) containing Modeling and Execution.

## RESTful

To test the rest-based implementation the RestTest-Class exists to create the server, which shall be later exchanged
with the main class that executes the main method and the server.
As of now the server will give you an response on localhost:8080/rest and will give you an json.

## Features

This JEngine does execute
* sequential
* usertasks
* data objects
* AND gateways
* termination condition for scenarios
